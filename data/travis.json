In 1912 he managed Woodrow Wilson's successful bid for the Democratic party Presidential nomination. New York architect Frank Freeman designed an innovative shingle style home for House on this site in 1890. The rambling structure was raised on a stone foundation and full basement. A broad-roofed first floor gallery wrapped around three sides of the house, above which rested a second floor accented by rounded corners and inset balconies. A third floor existed within in the massive roof structure, typing the house together with gabled dormers, turrets, and soaring stone chimneys. Although House sold the home in 1914, it was the site of many important political meetings during his residence here.

The Christian Church of Austin, as the congregation originally was know, acquired its first property at Eighth and Colorado Street and worshiped at that site until moving to this location in 1929. An early dispute over theological and procedural matters split the congregation in 1888. Until 1896, when the Rev.S .D. Dutcher was appointed pastor, leaders of the church were selected from among the laity. The fellowship adopted its current name during the early years of the twentieth century, after other disciples of Christ congregations had been organized in Austin.

An act of the State Legislature signed by Governor W. Lee O'Daniel in 1939 created the State Bar of Texas. Its purpose was to place all persons practicing law in the state under uniform rules and regulations.

Because of the financial success and a growing family, they later made plans for a larger home here. Construction of this two-story brick and cut stone house began in 1885 and the family moved in a year after completion. Designed and built by architect John Andrewartha, it features characteristics of Victorian and Eastlake styling. Exterior ornamentation includes a double gallery, a bay, strained glass, ornate woodwork, and intricate limestone detailing. The two-story stick style carriage house was built soon after completion of the main residence. The Hirshfelds had eight children. Two of their son's Jake and Sam, also became merchants and opened separate clothing stores. Jake and his brother Morris served as directors of the Austin National Bank, an institution their father helped establish in 1890.

During 1730-1731, Spanish friars located three missions here. Colorful settler William \"Uncle Billy\" Barton patented the land about 1837, naming two of the springs for his daughters Parthenia and Eliza. His two tame baby buffalos soon began to attract sightseers to his place, in spite of constant danger from Indian attacks. As the place gained in popularity, one astute Austin merchant installed a merry-go-round here and rented bathing suits to swimmers. In 1871 he and several others built ice-making machines at the springs. In addition, flour mills, sawmills, and a quarry appeared along the creek banks. About 1875 the riverboat \"Sunbeam\" ran excursions to Barton's at 50 cents a round trip. At one period a ferry was located here on a main road to Austin. Between 1901 and 1913 A. J. Zilker, leading merchant, bought this land and in 1918 and 1931 deeded it to the people of Austin for use as a park.",

In 1902 two of his children, Mary and Henry, opened Deep Eddy Resort. The Johnsons named the park for a deep hole in the limestone bed of Colorado River at this site that caused the water's current to from an eddy. Recreational facilities included campsites, picnic areas, rental cottages, and a cable ride into the river. Mary Johnson sold the park to A. J.Eilers in 1915. He built a concrete swimming pool in 1916 and renamed the resort Deep Eddy Bathing Beach. Managed by George A. Rowley, the resort featured such attractions as silent movies, a ferris wheel, carousel ride,a diving horse show, trapeze swing over the water, a 70-foot slide, and a 50-foot diving tower. The carnival atmosphere attracted hundreds of visitors each summer. On may 31,1935, two weeks later a devastating Colorado River flood inundated the city, swept away park improvements, and filled the pool with debris. With assistance from the federal Works Progress Administration, the city rebuilt the park. It reopened in 1936 as Eilers Park and Deep Eddy Swimming Pool.  (1991)",

Plans for implementing the program were developed under the leadership of school board President A. P. Wooldridge and Superintendent John B. Winn. Austin High School opened in September 1881 with an enrollment of 31 girls and 17 boys. Classes were first held on the third floor of West Austin School building at the corner on 11th and Rio Grande. Due to continued growth, classes were later moved to the First Baptist Church building, the temporary state Capitol, and the Smith Opera House. In 1900 the first high school building was completed at Trinity and 9th. When the enrollment outgrew the facilities there, the high school was moved to the campus of John T. Allan Junior High School on Rio Grande. Austin High School was moved again in 1975, following the completion of a new complex at this site. For over a century, Austin High School has been a leader in the development of innovative educational programs and has maintained a record of academic excellence that reflects the community's concern for the quality of education in Austin.

They merged 1864 into 1st Texas Volunteer Cavalry (Union).\r\n   Individual Texas prisoners of war obtained freedom by becoming \"galvanized Yankees\" -- men coating over their old opinions with blue uniforms. These fought Indians on frontiers, not old Confederate comrades. However, Texans in the Federal Army sometimes were in battle against old neighbors, or even their own relatives, in Red River campaigns in Louisiana, on the coast, and in south and west Texas.\r\n   On each side by turns were enlisted the partisan rangers of A. J. Vidal -- deserting the Confederates in 1863, the Federals and the war itself in 1864.\r\n   Federal soldiers from Texas were a small minority, because 90,000 Texans fought for the Confederacy..

Many newspapermen had closed shop and enlisted at once, when the war began. Others were forced to quit for lack of ink and paper, available only through Mexico or the blockaded Gulf Coast. A good pre-war paper had four 5-column pages, but many wartime issues were limited to half a page, printed on bill forms, wallpaper, tissue, straw paper, or brown wrapping paper. State subsidies for paper making resulted in very little production. Citizens made ink substitutes, but in very small quantities. \r\n\r\nTo get news, editors copied months' old letters or clippings from soldiers or blockade runners. The \"Texas Republican\" (Marshall) led in coverage, as it had the use of army telegraph items. The \"State Gazette\" (Austin) kept a pony express rider at the Brenham railhead to bring in Houston papers only 18 hours old. The Houston \"Telegraph\" had a staffer with the army, and shared with the Galveston \"News\" the expenses of a courier to and from Virginia--who also carried family and Confederate mail when slipping through Federal lines to cross the Mississippi.",

Although Texas did not have a system of free public education at that time, it did offer subsidies for students attending private tuition schools who could not pay.  The German-Texans organized a number of schools under this system, paying for teachers and buildings with a combination of state funds, donations and tuition.\r\n\r\nIn September 1857, the German-Texans in Austin held a public meeting to establish a German school for the city.  Civil engineer Wilhelm von Rosenberg donated land at this site for the school.  Within a month, German-Texan volunteers began construction of the school building.  The first school in Austin chartered by the Texas Legislature, the German Free School Association opened in 1858 with August Weilbacher and Julius Schutze as its first teachers.  \r\n\r\nThe 1857 building with rammed earth outer walls contained two classrooms and a basement.  About 1872, a two-story limestone section was added to provide four additional classrooms.  Julius Schutze returned to teach in 1880 and moved his family into the schoolhouse.  They continued to live in the building after the school closed in 1881 with the advent of Austin's public school system.  Schutze (d. 1904) published the Texas Vorwaerts newspaper here for a time and eventually gained title to the property. \r\n\r\nThe German Free School building, damaged in a 1919 fire, remained in use as both a single-family and multi-family residence until 1991, when it was deeded to the German-Texan Heritage Society.\r\n                  Recorded Texas Historic Landmark - 1962",

Smoot and Dabney both taught classes, but received no compensation. Although the school closed in 1895, continuing enthusiasm for a permanent seminary provided momentum to the Synod of Texas to appoint a committee to carry out this vision.\r\n\r\nThe new institution opened in 1902 as the Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary, with the Rev. Dr. Thornton Rogers Sampson as president. Classes were held at an East Austin Campus in a donated building. Wishing to take advantage of an academic partnership with the University of Texas, Sampson succeeded in moving the seminary campus to this site in 1908. Smoot's and Dabney's original goal of having seminary students remain in the region was realized, as graduates accepted calls to pastorates in Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Louisiana.\r\n\r\nAfter World War I, Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary began a Spanish-speaking department to serve the Hispanic population in south Texas.

President t. R. Sampson, hoping to create a strong association between the seminary and the University of Texas, promoted the relocation of the campus closer to the university.\r\n\r\nIn 1906, the seminary board purchased land at this site. With funds from the bequest of former Governor Francis R. Lubbock, a campus refectory (Lubbock Hall) was constructed in 1907. A second, larger building (later named Sampson Hall) was built to house dormitory rooms, offices, classrooms and the library. Both buildings were designed by Austin architect George Endress and constructed of buff brick with Mission Revival detailing. Five faculty homes were built on seminary property in 1909.\r\n\r\nDuring World War I, the Presbyterian Seminary closed temporarily and leased its buildings to the United States government until reopening in 1921. The seminary chapel, constructed in 1941, provided a strong focal point for the seminary campus.  By 1996, Sampson Hall, Lubbock Hall and the original faculty homes had been razed to make room for other facilities.\r\n\r\nThe seminary's relationship with the University of Texas, spurred by the proximity of the two campuses, continued to evolve over the years through regular classes, bible chair courses, lecture series and professor exchanges. Relocation to 27th street thus fulfilled President Sampson's dream for many educational opportunities for students at both institutions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(2002)",

His strong record led to his election as Speaker of the Texas House in 1943. Returning to public life after service in World War II, Daniel was Attorney General of Texas from 1947 until 1953.

Successful in sponsoring legislation to confirm Texas ownership of the tidelands, Daniel was elected Governor of Texas in 1956 and was reelected in 1958 and 1960. Among his many accomplishments as Governor, he championed the preservation of historic state documents and construction of the Lorenzo de Zavala State Archives and Library Building in Austin.\r\n  During the next three decades, Price Daniel served as head of the Office of Emergency Preparedness under President Johnson, as an Associate Justice of the Texas Supreme Court and as a member of the Texas State Library and Archives Commission.

Soon, his dry goods department faced Pecan (Sixth) Street, and the grocery department faced Brazos Street. Active civically, he served as a member of the group that encouraged the eventual construction of the Houston & Texas Central Railway, which was associated with Bremond's brother Paul. \r\n\r\n  John Bremond, a former firefighter, was instrumental in establishing Austin's first hook and ladder company. His sons Eugene and John, Jr., who were also active in the city's firefighting, joined him as business partners in 1865, forming John Bremond & Company. After their father's death the next year, the sons continued the business. In a back room of the store, Eugene operated a private loan operation that would become the State National Bank, or \"Bremond's Bank.\" He sold his share of the family business in 1870 but continued operating the bank, which received its charter in 1882. John, Jr. Then made his brother-in-law, John H. Robinson, Jr., a partner.\r\n \r\n  The John Henry Robinson family, proprietors of the J.H. Robinson & Son General Merchandise Store on Congress Avenue, was closely linked to the Bremonds, with three marriages among the children.\r\n \r\n  The Bremonds' store continued, shifting to wholesale operations after the railroad came to Austin in 1871. In 1905, it became one of the early companies to roast, grind and distribute its own coffee, eventually shipping its products across the state.\r\n \r\n  The business moved a few blocks away in 1924 and finally closed its doors in 1967. At the time it was demolished in 1979, the two-story limestone building was reportedly the oldest commercial structure in Austin. \r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(2003)",

In 1875-76, he returned to New York, and Gov. Richard Coke appointed Gen. Henry McCulloch as superintendent. McCulloch's leadership caused the faculty and staff, including then-principal Emily Lewis, to leave. During the tenure of the next superintendent, Col. John Salmon \"Rip\" Ford, Lewis returned to the staff, where she stayed until her retirement in 1914. In 1887, the state created what became the Texas Blind, Deaf and Orphan School, which served non-white students. From integration of the schools in 1965 until 2002, its campus in east Austin remained part of TSD's facilities.\r\n  The 20th century brought many changes to the campus facilities, administration and curriculum, including status as an independent school district.

Dwarfed by other structures by the late 20th century, the Norwood Tower remains unique in its design and elaborate detailing.\r\n\r\n   In 1925, Ollie O. Norwood (1887-1961) bought this site and hired the firm of Giesecke and Harris to design an office building. Bertram E. Giesecke (1892-1950) was the son of F.E. Giesecke, an architect, engineer and educator known for his experiments with reinforcing concrete. Bertram met August Watkins \"Watt\" Harris (1893-1968) in architecture school, and the men designed many buildings throughout Texas. The Gothic Revival tower, built of pre-cast concrete, features elaborate detailing, including a rose window, tracery, finials, gargoyles and a band of quatrefoils.\r\n\r\n   Norwood Tower opened in 1929. Early tenants included Renfro Drugstore and numerous medical professionals, as well as long-standing area companies, such as Gracy Title Co., Elgin-Butler Brick and Brown & Root. Following two terms as Texas governor, Dan Moody operated his law firm in the building. The top two floors of the 16-story edifice provided space for residential living.

Walter later became sole proprietor.\r\n  Located on the site of Edward's store, this company building was constructed in 1876-77. Designed by the noted Austin architect Jasper N. Preston, it features Victorian Italiante styling with Gothic details, an ornate cornice, carvings by local stonemasons, and side walls of limestone rubble. Interior cast iron columns on the ground fllor provided a large open commercial area. The third floor included a room for Masonic Lodge meetings and a 400-seat auditorium for use by the library association.\r\n  Tips later served in the Texas Senate, 1893-96, and in other state government positions. An active civic leader, he also helped found the Austin National Bank. The Walter Tips Company remained here until 1927 and the building later housed other businesses.

The City of Austin purchased 3,000 acres to lease to the federal government for use as an air base. Construction began in May 1942 after the removal of homes, churches and businesses, and the first units of the 316th Troop Carrier Group arrived in late September. The base was a replacement center for the First Troop Carrier Command, training pilots to transport combat troops and supplies.\r\n  In March 1943, the base was renamed Bergstrom Army Air Field to honor Captain John August Earl Bergstrom, Austin's first casualty of war; he was killed at Clark Field in the Phillipines on December 8, 1941. The base name was shortened to Bergstrom Field in November 1943. Crews from Bergstrom saw duty in the invasions of Normandy, southern France, Holland and Germany. After the war, the air field became Bergstrom Air Force Base, assigned to the Continental Air Command, and planes from here participated in the Berlin Airlift, 1948-49.\r\n  Over the next 50 years, Bergstrom served as part of both the Strategic Air Command and the Tactical Air Command, sending bombers and reconnaisance aircraft into combat theaters from Korea to Iraq. In 1968, the 12th Air Force moved its headquarters here to a newly completed circular building, nicknamed the \"Roundagon.\" Bergstrom Air Force Base closed in 1992 in compliance with the Base Realignment and Closure Commission, and the city converted it to Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in 1999.\r\n\r\nTexas in World War II, V+60 (2005)",

At 19 she began to study at the Academy of Arts, Munich, where her skill and charm brought many admirers, and her strong opinions made some think her eccentric.\r\n  Before she was 30, Elisabet had produced statues of German royalty and many European statesmen. In 1863 she married Dr. Edmund Montgomery, whom she had met as a young medical student from Scotland. In 1870 they moved to the United States and in 1872, to Texas, which they liked for its vastness and its high regard for freedom. They purchased the famous Liendo Plantation in present Waller County and there reared two sons, only one of whom lived to adulthood.\r\n  In 1892 Elisabet built this studio, \"Formosa,\" in which to execute statues of Stephen F. Austin and Sam Houston for the Texas exhibit at the 1893 World Fair. The statues now stand in the State Capitol. Here she also did a recumbent statue of military leader Albert Sidney Johnston, which lies over his grave at the State Cemetery in Austin. Elisabet Ney and Dr. Montgomery are both buried at Liendo.
